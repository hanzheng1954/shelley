// draftCache mirrors the message composer's autosave into localStorage so a
// reload (or a silently dropped network connection) can never lose unsent
// draft text.
//
// The server-side draft autosave (PUT /conversation/<id>/draft) is
// best-effort and debounced: there is always a window after a keystroke where
// the text lives only in the browser. If the tab reloads in that window, or
// the connection died without the user noticing, every PUT since the last
// successful one is lost. To plug that hole we additionally persist the draft
// to localStorage on EVERY keystroke (synchronous, no network).
//
// On load we read the draft from the server row and from localStorage and keep
// whichever is newer, WITHOUT any server-side schema change. The arbiter is
// the conversation row's existing `updated_at`, which the server bumps on each
// successful PUT /draft. Each keystroke we record, alongside the cached text,
// the server `updated_at` the composer was last in sync with (`basedOn`). On
// load the local copy wins iff its `basedOn` is >= the server's current
// `updated_at` AND its text differs — i.e. the user typed past what the server
// has acknowledged. This naturally covers the lost-connection case: failed
// PUTs never advance `updated_at`, so `basedOn` stays equal to it and the
// locally-typed text is preserved.
//
// We never try to flush localStorage back to the server; on the next keystroke
// the normal autosave carries the merged text forward and the two converge.
//
// Two kinds of session use this cache:
//   * Draft / new-conversation sessions HAVE a server copy, so they reconcile
//     via pickDraft() + `basedOn` as described above.
//   * The next-message composer of an already-sent (non-draft) conversation
//     has NO server-side draft, so its cache entry is authoritative: the
//     caller reads `value` directly and ignores `basedOn` (stored as "").
